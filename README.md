# Support-Vector-Machines-SVM-
Support Vector Machines (SVM) are supervised learning models used for classification and regression tasks. They find the optimal decision boundary (hyperplane) that separates classes with the largest margin. With different kernels, SVMs can handle both linear and non-linear classification problems.
